Dependencies
------------
You need Flask, Scrapy, and MongoDB. If you have pip, run the following to install the first two (easy_install works as well):

    pip install Flask
    pip install scrapy
    pip install pymongo

    Install MongoDB by heading to the MongoDB website and following the instructions there.


Running a scrape job
--------------------
1. Start MongoDB server (follow instructions from MongoDB website).
2. cd into the soc_crawler directory. The scrapy project writes to MongoDB, so make sure mongod is running. Then (assuming you've installed scrapy) run:

    scrapy crawl soc_modules

Running the webserver:
---------------------
    python server.py
