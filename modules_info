A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren&#8217;t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?", "tutorial_time_table": "null", "prerequisite": "Nil", "name": "FS: Randomness in Scientific Thinking"}, {"workload": "3-0-0-4-4", "exam": "null", "mc": "4", "lecture_time_table": [{"name": "SECTIONAL TEACHING Class [A1]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1200", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 5, "starttime": "900", "location": "BZ1/2-2"}]}, {"name": "SECTIONAL TEACHING Class [A2]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1500", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 5, "starttime": "1200", "location": "BZ1/2-2"}]}, {"name": "SECTIONAL TEACHING Class [A3]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1500", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 4, "starttime": "1200", "location": "BZ1/2-3"}]}], "preclusion": "BH3103 or BZ3303 or BK3102 or FNA3103 or FIN3103 or FIN3103B", "code": "FIN3103A", "desc": "This course seeks to provide an understanding of the role of financial markets in the economy.

By studying the ways in which religion exists in these texts, we can see the vitality of cultural expression and learn about how religion exists in the public imagination. No prior training in artistic interpretation or religious history is required, though the course presumes a healthy curiosity about religious phenomena and cultural expression. The course trains students to think about why people sometimes enjoy seeing films about painful topics, what is the difference between &#8220;studying&#8221; and &#8220;practicing&#8221; religion is, and how we discuss whether an innovative vision is &#8220;authentic.&#8221;", "tutorial_time_table": [{"name": "TUTORIAL Class [D1]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1200", "occurence": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "day": 4, "starttime": "1000", "location": "AS5/0205"}]}, {"name": "TUTORIAL Class [D2]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1600", "occurence": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13], "day": 4, "starttime": "1400", "location": "AS5/0205"}]}, {"name": "TUTORIAL Class [E1]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1200", "occurence": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "day": 4, "starttime": "1000", "location": "AS5/0205"}]}, {"name": "TUTORIAL Class [E2]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1600", "occurence": [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12], "day": 4, "starttime": "1400", "location": "AS5/0205"}]}], "prerequisite": "Nil", "name": "Religion and Film"}, {"workload": "2-0-2-4-4", "exam": {"date": "2012-04-24", "time": "PM"}, "mc": "4", "lecture_time_table": [{"name": "LECTURE Class [1]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1400", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 3, "starttime": "1200", "location": "SR@LT19"}]}], "preclusion": "CS1305; GEM1501M.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. On the other hand, probably all biological reactions occur in salty water. Water covers twothirds of our planet. At least to our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the &#8216;matrix of life&#8217; which is not just a passive scaffold but also has many active roles in molecular biology. There are various scientific debates associated with water. For example, in the late 1960s, Russian chemist Boris Deryaguin and his colleagues claimed that polywater, a gel-like form of water, could be observed in small capillary tubes. Even more unbelievably, in the 1980s Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the &#8216;memory of water&#8217;, whereby the liquid water could allegedly be imprinted by biomolecular information which is now extensively used to justify homeopathy. In this module, we will explore how water, together with salts, shaped the emergence and evolution of life and also the students will have a full freedom to give your own opinions on the debates.

The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design.

Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention.

Decision-making is becoming increasingly challenging in a fast-paced business world where managers must make frequent decisions in the face of rising uncertainty and complexity. This course will take a systematic view of management decision making from both normative and descriptive perspectives. While the normative perspective focuses on what rational managers should do in order to make optimal decisions, the descriptive perspective offers critical insights about how real managers make judgment and decisions. Class discussion will be organized around the contrasts between what decision-makers should do in a normative sense and how they actually do in a descriptive sense. The normative approach may help decision makers to identify, structure, and analyze decision problems in a systematic and logical manner. On the other hand, the descriptive approach has provided insightful understandings of how people deviate from rational decision making and easily fall into common decision traps. This course will teach you how to think critically about the decisions you and other people make, how to avoid common decision pitfalls, and how to improve your decision making skills by offering a comprehensive cross-disciplinary knowledge of decision making and more importantly its real life applications.", "tutorial_time_table": "null", "prerequisite": "DSC1007 and BSP1005", "name": "Managerial Decision Analysis"}, {"workload": "3-0-0-2-5", "exam": {"date": "2012-04-21", "time": "AM"}, "mc": "4", "lecture_time_table": [{"name": "LECTURE Class [1]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1200", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 2, "starttime": "1000", "location": "LT27"}, {"endtime": "2000", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 4, "starttime": "1800", "location": "LT27"}]}, {"name": "LECTURE Class [2]", "sessions": [{"endtime": "1600", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 3, "starttime": "1400", "location": "LT27"}, {"endtime": "2000", "occurence": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "day": 5, "starttime": "1800", "location": "LT27"}]}], "preclusion": "EC1101E, EC1311, BK1008, BZ1006/BH1005/BSP1005, USSE01, USE2301, EC1310, BSP2001/BH2001/BZ2001.
